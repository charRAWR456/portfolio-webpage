          <h5>Hello, my name is Jamie Laurelann Pittak. My favroite color is lime green, I have three cats (Chomper, Luna and Iggy) and two dogs (Chewie and Pixel). </h5>
          <p>
            I grew up in Edmonds and have lived in Washington state my entire life excluding 3 years.After high school I started going to school for <a href="https://www.shoreline.edu/areas-of-study/documents/majorPlanningSheets/MUSTC-Digital-Audio-Engineering-AAAS.pdf">Digital Audio Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.shoreline.edu/">Shoreline Community College</a>.
            Before my final sememster of the program we were tasked with creating an audio file for a video game. While I had always played video games in my spare time, I had never really questioned why or how they work.
            This sparked the need to create somthing, that had always been inside me, in a new way. I decided that instead of finishing Audio Engineering I would move to a random state and study video game programming.
          </p>

          <p>
            I landed in Arizona, a state I knew noone, and started my new adventure. I found a college called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_College_(Phoenix)">Collins College</a> that offered a Video Game Programming.
            I had been skeptical at first but decided to ignore the red flags. It was a year into my program and I had to face the truth. Why had we not touched a computer? Why did my art concept teacher have a degree in science and could only draw stick figures?
            Why was I taking an art class? Why could noone give me a straight answer as to when we would start learning programming? Needless to say I decided it was best to stop giving them my money and find a new path.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found a new school called University of Advancing Technology it was a private University that focused on Network Security and Video Game Programming. What could go wrong!? Well let me tell you. My first year was great. It was spent actually learning
            programming! I learned the basics of Python and was ready to move on and learn the next language C++. But wait, where did all the teachers go? Why was I in a class where the teacher was pulling up Youtube tutorials instead of teaching us. Why when we had questions
            could he not answer them and had to pull up Google everytime? The school had decided that trading in the highest paid teachers for the 4 brand new Surface tables that had chess loaded on them was worth the education of their students. At this point I felt my programming
            education was over. I couldn't catch a break, just $40,000 of debt. My time in Arizona was coming to an end.
          </p>
          <p>
            I may have found my now husband while I was in Arizona and opened an LLC for a company I was going to pursue, but I missed the green. I missed the rain. I had no reason to be in Arizona anymore. So back to Washington I went. I got a job in HR, got married, and built my life. I was comfortable. I ignored the nagging voice telling me
            to do more. My husband who works in Network Security recognized my want to do more and suggested I give programming one last chance. I disagreed at first due to the fear of the past but came around to the idea. We took an intro to  programming class together to see if I still liked it and sure enough I did and started looking into bootcamps.
            Which brings me to today. The end of my first week of class.
