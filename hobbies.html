          I have many interests from hanging out with friends to learning new things. Below are the main hobbies that make up a majority of my life outside of programming.

                    Music has always been a huge part of my life. I started playing trumpet when I was in 5th grade and picked up the piano a year later. In middle school I started
                    teaching myself guitar and bass.

                      I have always enjoyed playing and collecting video games. I enjoy not only the challange it supplies but the social aspect of it as well.
                       Currently the only system I am missing is an Atari and Super Nintendo. My favorite game of all time is Heavy Rain.

                      I love to travel not only to see the beauty of the location but to also learn about the culture and how it differs from my culture.
